# Simple ER model extraction API (OpenAPI generated FastAPI server)

This API is meant to provide ER model extraction features for certain data formats like XML, JSON, CSV, SQL and OWL.
It is part of a larger data integration application that works on a conceptual model level (entity-relationship-model).
This Python package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project using a customized fastAPI template.
The generation process can be reviewed in the base project [repository](https://github.com/Cpprentice/FAIRlead-model-extraction).


## Installation & Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
pip install simpler-api
uvicorn simpler_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7373
```

and open your browser at `http://localhost:7373/docs/` to see the docs.

## Running with Docker

The FAIRlead ER extraction [repository](https://github.com/Cpprentice/FAIRlead-model-extraction) contains a Dockerfile for building the API into an image.
It is likely that it will be available on docker hub in the future.
